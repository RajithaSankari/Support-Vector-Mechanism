## Project Title: Using the support vector mechanism algorithem of superwise machine learning, predict iris.csv dataset to find out species will be same or different.
# Problem Statement: A American based botnical gardens grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different type of variety flower is grow.As a Data Science Engineer find out how much accuracy is there all catagories contains same species.
# Task1:Preprocess the data in skit.learn library.
# Task2: Load the data using sklearn model selection default argument.
# Task3:On the basis of dataset train test split your SVM model.
# Task4: Implement support vector mechanism classifier using svm_classifier.The svm must be "Linear".
# Task5: Train the classifier on the training data.
# Task6: Find out the prediction values on the test data.
# Task7: Test the modelwith the help of accuracy,accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1.
# Import Libraries
# # Load the Iris dataset
# # Consider only two classes for simplicity
# # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
## Create an SVM classifier
## Train the classifier on the training data

## Make predictions on the test data
## Calculate accuracy

## Conclusion: According to my support vector model the species are linear.With the accuracy of 1.00.
Hence model was successfully implemented.
